     <div><strong>UMT RESEARCHER RECEIVES RM460,000 GRANT FOR CORAL REEF CONSERVATION PROJECT </strong></div>
         <br> 
         <p>KUALA NERUS, 10 November – Universiti Malaysia Terengganu (UMT) continues to strengthen its reputation as a leader in marine science when its researcher, Associate Professor Dr. Tan Chun Hong from the Faculty of Science and Marine Environment (FSSM), has successfully secured an international grant worth USD 99,244 (approximately RM460,000) from the Coral Research & Development Accelerator Platform (CORDAP).

 

The funding is for the implementation of a project titled “Larval-Highway: A Scalable Larval Collection with Targeted Settlement System for Reef Rehabilitation,” led by UMT.
This pioneering project introduces “Larval-Highway”, which is  a new, low-cost, and eco-friendly method designed to accelerate coral reef rehabilitation directly in the ocean.

 
<br>
<br>
The method was developed based on over five years of coral research conducted around Bidong Island, the system works by collecting coral larvae and releasing them naturally.
This nature-based approach enables large-scale coral restoration with a minimal carbon footprint while also encouraging active participation from local communities and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in marine ecosystem rehabilitation efforts.
The project will first be implemented at Bidong Island as the main research and technology testing site before expanding to Redang Island, which will serve as the hub for community engagement and coral restoration training programs.

 

It will be carried out in strategic collaboration with Prince of Songkla University (Hatyai, Thailand) and Reef Check Malaysia, combining regional expertise in coral ecology and community-based conservation methods.

According to Associate Professor Dr. Tan Chun Hong, receiving the CORDAP grant is a recognition of UMT researchers’ expertise in tropical coral ecology and marine conservation.
“Larval-Highway is designed to enhance natural coral recovery by harnessing ocean currents to distribute larvae to degraded reef areas. With low cost and minimal carbon impact, this system has the potential to become a sustainable coral restoration model not only for Malaysia but also for the wider Southeast Asian region,” he said.
Meanwhile, UMT Vice-Chancellor, Professor Ir. Ts. Dr. Mohd Zamri Ibrahim expressed his pride in the achievement, noting that it aligns with the university’s aspiration to become a global reference centre in tropical marine science.

 
<br>
<br>
“Dr. Tan’s success demonstrates that UMT has internationally recognized experts capable of competing in impactful global research that contributes to the sustainability of marine resources. This also reinforces UMT’s role in supporting Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14: Life Below Water,” he said.

 

CORDAP is an international platform under the G20 global initiative that supports research and technological development to accelerate coral reef restoration worldwide. Only projects with high potential for global impact on marine conservation are selected for this prestigious funding.

 

The implementation of the “Larval-Highway” project will not only strengthen UMT’s position as a leader in marine research in the region but also directly contribute to coral conservation efforts within the Coral Triangle, which is one of the world’s richest marine biodiversity zones.</p>
